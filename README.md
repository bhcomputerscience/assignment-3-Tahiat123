So , for the interactive ice cream shop - there are 5 flavor buttons - chocolate , vanilla , strawberry , butterscotch and pistachio , all of the flavor's base prices are $3.0 dollars , and there are also 4 toppings buttons - chocolate cream , cherry , sprinkles and whip cream , the price of chocolate cream and cherry  are $1.0 dollars each and price of whip cream and sprinkles are are $1.75 dollars each , the user can choose flavors and toppings and the cost adds up . This is pretty much how my code works , compared to my peers , my idea is much simpler and basic!
